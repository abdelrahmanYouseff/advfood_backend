# ðŸŽ‰ Noon Payment Integration - SUCCESS!

## Status: âœ… WORKING

Your Noon payment integration is now working correctly! The response you received shows a successful payment initiation.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. âœ… Category Changed: `"general"` â†’ `"pay"`
As per Noon support's instructions, the order category is now correctly set to `"pay"`.
